<p>Welcome to the nearcore development guide!</p>
<p>The target audience of this guide are developers of nearcore itself. If you are
a user of NEAR (either a contract developer, or validator running a node),
please refer to the user docs at <a href="https://docs.near.org">https://docs.near.org</a>.</p>
<p>This guide is build with <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html">mdBook</a>
from sources in the <a href="https://github.com/near/nearcore/">nearcore repository</a>.
You can edit it by pressing the &quot;edit&quot; icon in the top right corner, we welcome
all contributions. The guide is hosted at <a href="https://near.github.io/nearcore/">https://near.github.io/nearcore/</a>.</p>
<p>The guide is organized as a collection of loosely coupled chapters -- you don't
need to read them in order, feel free to peruse the TOC, and focus on
the interesting bits. The chapters are classified into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./architecture/index.html"><strong>Architecture</strong></a> talks about how the code works.
So, for example, if you are interested in how a transaction flows through the
system, look there!</li>
<li><a href="./practices/index.html"><strong>Practices</strong></a> describe, broadly, how we write code.
For example, if you want to learn about code style, issue tracking, or
debugging performance problems, this is the chapter for you.</li>
<li>Finally, the <a href="./misc/index.html"><strong>Misc</strong></a> part holds various assorted bits
and pieces. We are trying to bias ourselves towards writing more docs, so, if
you want to document something and it doesn't cleanly map to a category above,
just put it in misc!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure, start with the next chapter, <a href="./architecture/index.html">Architecture Overview</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>This document describes the high-level architecture of nearcore. The focus here
is on the implementation of the blockchain protocol, not the protocol itself.
For reference documentation of the protocol, please refer to
<a href="https://nomicon.io/">nomicon</a></p>
<h2 id="birds-eye-view"><a class="header" href="#birds-eye-view">Bird's Eye View</a></h2>
<p><img src="architecture//images/architecture.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Since nearcore is an implementation of NEAR blockchain protocol, its goal is to
produce a binary that runs as a blockchain client. More specifically, the
<code>neard</code> binary can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate files necessary to start a node</li>
<li>start a node with a given folder that contains required data</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three major components of nearcore:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network. We implement a peer-to-peer network that powers communications
between blockchain nodes. This includes initiating connections with other
nodes, maintaining a view of the entire network, routing messages to the right
nodes, etc. Network is a somewhat standalone module, though it uses
information about validators to propagate and validate certain messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chain. Chain is responsible for building and maintaining the blockchain data
structure. This includes block and chunk production and processing, consensus,
and validator selection. However, chain is not responsible for actually
applying transactions and receipts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Runtime. Runtime is the execution engine that actually applies transactions
and receipts and performs state transitions. This also includes compilation of
contracts (wasm binaries) and execution of contract calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entry-points"><a class="header" href="#entry-points">Entry Points</a></h2>
<p><code>neard/src/main.rs</code> contains the main function that starts a blockchain node.
However, this file mostly only contains the logic to parse arguments and
dispatch different commands.</p>
<p><code>start_with_config</code> in <code>nearcore/src/lib.rs</code> is the actual entry point and it
starts all the actors.</p>
<h2 id="code-map"><a class="header" href="#code-map">Code Map</a></h2>
<p>This section contains some high-level overview of important crates and data
structures.</p>
<h3 id="coreprimitives"><a class="header" href="#coreprimitives"><code>core/primitives</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate contains most of the types that are shared across different crates.</p>
<h3 id="coreprimitives-core"><a class="header" href="#coreprimitives-core"><code>core/primitives-core</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate contains types needed for runtime.</p>
<h3 id="corestoretrie"><a class="header" href="#corestoretrie"><code>core/store/trie</code></a></h3>
<p>This directory contains the MPT state implementation. Note that we usually use
<code>TrieUpdate</code> to interact with the state.</p>
<h3 id="chainchain"><a class="header" href="#chainchain"><code>chain/chain</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate contains most of the chain logic (consensus, block processing, etc).
<code>ChainUpdate::process_block</code> is where most of the block processing logic
happens.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture Invariant</strong>: interface between chain and runtime is defined by
<code>RuntimeAdapter</code>. All invocations of runtime goes through <code>RuntimeAdapter</code></p>
<p><strong>State update</strong></p>
<p>The blockchain state can be changed in the following two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying a chunk. This is how the state is normally updated: through
<code>Runtime::apply</code>.</li>
<li>State sync. State sync can happen in two cases:
<ul>
<li>A node is far enough behind the most recent block and triggers state sync to
fast forward to the state of a very recent block without having to apply
blocks in the middle.</li>
<li>A node is about to become validator for some shard in the next epoch, but it
does not yet have the state for that shard. In this case, it would run state
sync through the <code>catchup</code> routine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chainchunks"><a class="header" href="#chainchunks"><code>chain/chunks</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate contains most of the sharding logic which includes chunk creation,
distribution, and processing. <code>ShardsManager</code> is the main struct that
orchestrates everything here.</p>
<h3 id="chainclient"><a class="header" href="#chainclient"><code>chain/client</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate defines two important structs, <code>Client</code> and <code>ViewClient</code>. <code>Client</code>
includes everything necessary for the chain (without network and runtime) to
function and runs in a single thread. <code>ViewClient</code> is a &quot;read-only&quot; client that
answers queries without interfering with the operations of <code>Client</code>.
<code>ViewClient</code> runs in multiple threads.</p>
<h3 id="chainnetwork"><a class="header" href="#chainnetwork"><code>chain/network</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate contains the entire implementation of the p2p network used by NEAR
blockchain nodes.</p>
<p>Two important structs here: <code>PeerManagerActor</code> and <code>Peer</code>. Peer manager
orchestrates all the communications from network to other components and from
other components to network. <code>Peer</code> is responsible for low-level network
communications from and to a given peer. Peer manager runs in one thread while
each <code>Peer</code> runs in its own thread.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture Invariant</strong>: Network communicates to <code>Client</code> through
<code>NetworkClientMessages</code> and to <code>ViewClient</code> through <code>NetworkViewClientMessages</code>.
Conversely, <code>Client</code> and <code>ViewClient</code> communicates to network through
<code>NetworkRequests</code>.</p>
<h3 id="chainepoch_manager"><a class="header" href="#chainepoch_manager"><code>chain/epoch_manager</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate is responsible for determining validators and other epoch related
information such as epoch id for each epoch.</p>
<p>Note: <code>EpochManager</code> is constructed in <code>NightshadeRuntime</code> rather than in
<code>Chain</code>, partially because we had this idea of making epoch manager a smart
contract.</p>
<h3 id="chainjsonrpc"><a class="header" href="#chainjsonrpc"><code>chain/jsonrpc</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate implements <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a> API server to enable
submission of new transactions and inspection of the blockchain data, the
network state, and the node status. When a request is processed, it generates a
message to either <code>ClientActor</code> or <code>ViewClientActor</code> to interact with the
blockchain. For queries of blockchain data, such as block, chunk, account, etc,
the request usually generates a message to <code>ViewClientActor</code>. Transactions, on
the other hand, are sent to <code>ClientActor</code> for further processing.</p>
<h3 id="runtimeruntime"><a class="header" href="#runtimeruntime"><code>runtime/runtime</code></a></h3>
<p>This crate contains the main entry point to runtime -- <code>Runtime::apply</code>. This
function takes <code>ApplyState</code>, which contains necessary information passed from
chain to runtime, and a list of <code>SignedTransaction</code> and a list of <code>Receipt</code>, and
returns a <code>ApplyResult</code>, which includes state changes, execution outcomes, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture Invariant</strong>: The state update is only finalized at the end of
<code>apply</code>. During all intermediate steps state changes can be reverted.</p>
<h3 id="runtimenear-vm-logic"><a class="header" href="#runtimenear-vm-logic"><code>runtime/near-vm-logic</code></a></h3>
<p><code>VMLogic</code> contains all the implementations of host functions and is the
interface between runtime and wasm. <code>VMLogic</code> is constructed when runtime
applies function call actions. In <code>VMLogic</code>, interaction with NEAR blockchain
happens in the following two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>VMContext</code>, which contains lightweight information such as current block
hash, current block height, epoch id, etc.</li>
<li><code>External</code>, which is a trait that contains functions to interact with
blockchain by either reading some nontrivial data, or writing to the
blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="runtimenear-vm-runner"><a class="header" href="#runtimenear-vm-runner"><code>runtime/near-vm-runner</code></a></h3>
<p><code>run</code> function in <code>runner.rs</code> is the entry point to the vm runner. This function
essentially spins up the vm and executes some function in a contract. It
supports different wasm compilers including wasmer0, wasmer2, and wasmtime
through compile-time feature flags. Currently we use wasmer0 and wasmer2 in
production. The <code>imports</code> module exposes host functions defined in
<code>near-vm-logic</code> to WASM code. In other words, it defines the ABI of the
contracts on NEAR.</p>
<h3 id="neard"><a class="header" href="#neard"><code>neard</code></a></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, <code>neard</code> is the crate that contains that main entry points.
All the actors are spawned in <code>start_with_config</code>. It is also worth noting that
<code>NightshadeRuntime</code> is the struct that implements <code>RuntimeAdapter</code>.</p>
<h3 id="corestoresrcdbrs"><a class="header" href="#corestoresrcdbrs"><code>core/store/src/db.rs</code></a></h3>
<p>This file contains schema (DBCol) of our internal RocksDB storage - a good
starting point when reading the code base.</p>
<h2 id="cross-cutting-concerns"><a class="header" href="#cross-cutting-concerns">Cross Cutting Concerns</a></h2>
<h3 id="observability"><a class="header" href="#observability">Observability</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://tracing.rs">tracing</a> crate is used for structured, hierarchical
event output and logging. We also integrate <a href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus</a>
for light-weight metric output. See the <a href="architecture/./style.html">style</a> documentation for
more information on the usage.</p>
<h3 id="testing"><a class="header" href="#testing">Testing</a></h3>
<p>Rust has built-in support for writing unit tests by marking functions
with <code>#[test]</code> directive.  Take full advantage of that!  Testing not
only confirms that what was written works the way it was intended but
also help during refactoring since the caught unintended behaviour
changes.</p>
<p>Not all tests are created equal though and while some can need only
milliseconds to run, others may run for several seconds or even
minutes.  Tests that take a long time should be marked as such with an
<code>expensive_tests</code> feature, for example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[test]
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = &quot;expensive_tests&quot;), ignore)]
fn test_catchup_random_single_part_sync() {
    test_catchup_random_single_part_sync_common(false, false, 13)
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Such tests will be ignored by default and can be executed by using
<code>--ignored</code> or <code>--include-ignored</code> flag as in <code>cargo test -- --ignored</code> or by compiling the tests with <code>expensive_tests</code> feature
enabled.</p>
<p>Because expensive tests are not run by default, they are also not run
in CI.  Instead, they are run nightly and need to be explicitly
included in <code>nightly/expensive.txt</code> file; for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">expensive --timeout=1800 near-client near_client tests::catching_up::test_catchup_random_single_part_sync
expensive --timeout=1800 near-client near_client tests::catching_up::test_catchup_random_single_part_sync --features nightly
</code></pre>
<p>For more details regarding nightly tests see <code>nightly/README.md</code>.</p>
<p>Note that what counts as a slow test isn’t exactly defined as of now.
If it takes just a couple seconds than it’s probably fine.  Anything
slower should probably be classified as expensive test.  In
particular, if libtest complains the test takes more than 60 seconds
than it definitely is.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="trie"><a class="header" href="#trie">Trie</a></h1>
<p>We use Merkle-Patricia Trie to store blockchain state. Trie is persistent, which
means that insertion of new node actually leads to creation of new path to this
node, and thus root of Trie after insertion will also be presented by new
object.</p>
<p>Here we describe its implementation details which are closely related to
Runtime.</p>
<h2 id="main-structures"><a class="header" href="#main-structures">Main structures</a></h2>
<h3 id="trie-1"><a class="header" href="#trie-1">Trie</a></h3>
<p>Trie stores the state - accounts, contract codes, access keys, etc. Each state
item corresponds to the unique trie key. All types of trie keys are described in
the <a href="architecture/trie.html#triekey">TrieKey</a> section. You can read more about this structure on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Trie is stored in the RocksDB, which is persistent across node restarts. Trie
communicates with database using <code>TrieStorage</code>. On the database level, data is
stored in key-value format in <code>DBCol::State</code> column. There are two kinds of
records:</p>
<ul>
<li>trie nodes, for which key is constructed from shard id and
<code>RawTrieNodeWithSize</code> hash, and value is a <code>RawTrieNodeWithSize</code> serialized by
custom algorithm;</li>
<li>values (encoded contract codes, postponed receipts, etc.), for which key is
constructed from shard id and hash of value, which maps to the encoded value.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, value can be obtained from <code>TrieKey</code> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>start from the hash of <code>RawTrieNodeWithSize</code> corresponding to the root;</li>
<li>descend to the needed node using nibbles from <code>TrieKey</code>;</li>
<li>extract underlying <code>RawTrieNode</code>;</li>
<li>if it is a <code>Leaf</code> or <code>Branch</code>, it should contain hash of the value;</li>
<li>get value from storage by its hash and shard id.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>Trie</code> is almost never called directly from <code>Runtime</code>, modifications
are made using <code>TrieUpdate</code>.</p>
<h3 id="trieupdate"><a class="header" href="#trieupdate">TrieUpdate</a></h3>
<p>Provides a way to access storage and record changes to commit in the future.
Update is prepared as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes are made using <code>set</code> and <code>remove</code> methods, which are added to
<code>prospective</code> field,</li>
<li>call <code>commit</code> method which moves <code>prospective</code> changes to <code>committed</code>,</li>
<li>call <code>finalize</code> method which prepares <code>TrieChanges</code> and state changes based on
<code>committed</code> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>finalize</code>, <code>Trie::insert</code> and <code>Trie::update</code> do not update the
database storage. These functions only modify trie nodes in memory. Instead,
these functions prepares <code>TrieChanges</code> object, and <code>Trie</code> is actually updated
when <code>ShardTries::apply_insertions</code> is called, which puts new values to
<code>DBCol::State</code> part of key-value database.</p>
<h3 id="triestorage"><a class="header" href="#triestorage">TrieStorage</a></h3>
<p>Stores all <code>Trie</code> nodes and allows to get serialized nodes by <code>TrieKey</code> hash
using <code>retrieve_raw_bytes</code> method.</p>
<p>There are three implementations of <code>TrieStorage</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TrieCachingStorage</code> - caches big values ever read by <code>retrieve_raw_bytes</code>.</li>
<li><code>TrieRecordingStorage</code> - records all key-value pairs ever read by
<code>retrieve_raw_bytes</code>. Used for obtaining state parts (and challenges in the
future).</li>
<li><code>TrieMemoryPartialStorage</code> - used for validating recorded partial storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these storages use database keys, which are retrieved using hashes of
trie nodes using <code>get_key_from_shard_id_and_hash</code> method.</p>
<h3 id="shardtries"><a class="header" href="#shardtries">ShardTries</a></h3>
<p>Contains stores and caches and allows to get <code>Trie</code> object for any shard.</p>
<h2 id="primitives"><a class="header" href="#primitives">Primitives</a></h2>
<h3 id="triekey"><a class="header" href="#triekey">TrieKey</a></h3>
<p>Describes all keys which may be inserted to <code>Trie</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Account</code></li>
<li><code>ContractCode</code></li>
<li><code>AccessKey</code></li>
<li><code>ReceivedData</code></li>
<li><code>PostponedReceiptId</code></li>
<li><code>PendingDataCount</code></li>
<li><code>PostponedReceipt</code></li>
<li><code>DelayedReceiptIndices</code></li>
<li><code>DelayedReceipt</code></li>
<li><code>ContractData</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Each key is uniquely converted to <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>. Internally, each such vector is
converted to <code>NibbleSlice</code> (nibble is a half of a byte), and each its item
corresponds to one step down in <code>Trie</code>.</p>
<h3 id="triechanges"><a class="header" href="#triechanges">TrieChanges</a></h3>
<p>Stores result of updating <code>Trie</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>old_root</code>: root before updating <code>Trie</code>, i.e. inserting new nodes and deleting
old ones,</li>
<li><code>new_root</code>: root after updating <code>Trie</code>,</li>
<li><code>insertions</code>, <code>deletions</code>: vectors of <code>TrieRefcountChange</code>, describing all
inserted and deleted nodes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trierefcountchange"><a class="header" href="#trierefcountchange">TrieRefcountChange</a></h3>
<p>Because we remove unused nodes during garbage collection, we need to track
reference count (<code>rc</code>) for each node. Another reason is that we can dedup
values. If the same contract is deployed 1000 times, we only store one contract
binary in storage and track its count.</p>
<p>This structure is used to update <code>rc</code> in the database:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trie_node_or_value_hash</code> - hash of the trie node or value, used for uniting
with shard id to get DB key,</li>
<li><code>trie_node_or_value</code> - serialized trie node or value,</li>
<li><code>rc</code> - change of reference count.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that for all reference-counted records, the actual value stored in DB is
the concatenation of <code>trie_node_or_value</code> and <code>rc</code>. The reference count is
updated using custom merge operation <code>merge_refcounted_records</code>.</p>

<p><code>EdgeValidatorActor</code> runs on separate thread. The purpose of this <code>actor</code> is to
validate <code>edges</code>, where each <code>edge</code> represents a connection between two peers,
and it's signed with a cryptographic signature of both parties. The process of
edge validation involves verifying cryptographic signatures, which can be quite
expensive, and therefore was moved to another thread.</p>

<p><code>PeerManagerActor</code> is the main actor of <code>near-network</code> crate. It's acts as a
bridge connecting to the world outside, the other peers, and <code>ClientActor</code> and
<code>ClientViewActor</code>, which handle processing any operations on the chain.
<code>PeerManagerActor</code> maintains information about p2p network via (Routing Table
Actor), and indirectly, through <code>PeerActor</code>, connections to all some nodes on
the network. All messages going to other nodes, or coming from other nodes will
be routed through this <code>Actor</code>. <code>PeerManagerActor</code> is responsible for accepting
incoming connections from the outside world and creating <code>PeerActors</code> to manage
them.</p>
<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepting new connections</li>

<p>Then, it updates <code>edge_verifier_requests_in_progress</code> to mark that edge
verifications are in progress, and edges shouldn't be pruned from Routing Table

<p>If any edge is not valid peer will be banned.</p>
<p>Edges that are validated are written to a concurrent queue
<code>ValidateEdgeList::sender</code>. This queue is used to transfer edges from

<li>Removing unreachable edges from memory and storing them to disk.</li>
<li>The distance is calculated as the minimum number of nodes on the path from

<p>This section describes different protocols of sending messages currently used in
<code>Near</code></p>
<h2 id="101-messages-between-actors"><a class="header" href="#101-messages-between-actors">10.1 Messages between Actors.</a></h2>
<p><code>Near</code> is build on <code>Actix</code>'s <code>actor</code> framework.
(https://actix.rs/book/actix/sec-2-actor.html) Usually each actor runs on its
own dedicated thread. Some, like <code>PeerActor</code> have one thread per each instance.
Only messages implementing <code>actix::Message</code>, can be sent using between threads.
Each actor has its own queue; Processing of messages happens asynchronously.</p>
<p>We should not leak implementation details into the spec.</p>
<p>Actix messages can be found by looking for <code>impl actix::Message</code>.</p>
<h2 id="102-messages-sent-through-tcp"><a class="header" href="#102-messages-sent-through-tcp">10.2 Messages sent through TCP</a></h2>
<p>Near is using <code>borsh</code> serialization to exchange messages between nodes (See
https://borsh.io/). We should be careful when making changes to them. We have to
maintain backward compatibility. Only messages implementing <code>BorshSerialize</code>,
<code>BorshDeserialize</code> can be sent. We also use <code>borsh</code> for database storage.</p>
<h2 id="103-messages-sentreceived-through-chainjsonrpc"><a class="header" href="#103-messages-sentreceived-through-chainjsonrpc">10.3 Messages sent/received through <code>chain/jsonrpc</code></a></h2>
<p>Near runs a <code>json REST server</code>. (See <code>actix_web::HttpServer</code>). All messages sent
and received must implement <code>serde::Serialize</code> and <code>serde::Deserialize</code>.</p>
<h1 id="11-code-flow---routing-a-message"><a class="header" href="#11-code-flow---routing-a-message">11. Code flow - routing a message</a></h1>
<p>This is the example of the message that is being sent between nodes
(<code>RawRoutedMessage</code>)
(https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/fa8749dc60fe0de8e94c3046571731c622326e9f/chain/network-primitives/src/types.rs#L362)</p>
<p>Each of these methods have a <code>target</code> - that is either the account_id or peer_id
or hash (which seems to be used only for route back...). If target is the
account - it will be converted using <code>routing_table.account_owner</code> to the peer.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the message, the <code>PeerManagerActor</code> will sign it
(https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/master/chain/network/src/peer_manager.rs#L1285)
And convert into RoutedMessage (which also have things like TTL etc.).</p>
<p>Then it will use the <code>routing_table</code>, to find the route to the target peer (add
<code>route_back</code> if needed) and then send the message over the network as
<code>PeerMessage::Routed</code>. Details about routing table computations are covered in
section 8.</p>
<p>When Peer receives this message (as <code>PeerMessage::Routed</code>), it will pass it to
PeerManager (as <code>RoutedMessageFrom</code>), which would then check if the message is
for the current <code>PeerActor</code>. (if yes, it would pass it for the client) and if
not - it would pass it along the network.</p>
<p>All these messages are handled by <code>receive_client_message</code> in Peer.
(<code>NetworkClientMessags</code>) - and transferred to <code>ClientActor</code> in
(<code>chain/client/src/client_actor.rs</code>)</p>
<p><code>NetworkRequests</code> to <code>PeerManager</code> actor trigger the <code>RawRoutedMessage</code> for
messages that are meant to be sent to another <code>peer</code>.</p>
<p><code>lib.rs</code> (<code>ShardsManager</code>) has a <code>network_adapter</code> - coming from client’s
network_adapter that comes from <code>ClientActor</code> that comes from start_client call
that comes from <code>start_with_config</code> (that crates <code>PeerManagerActor</code> - that is
passed as target to <code>network_recipent</code>).</p>

<p>Everytime a group of peers becomes unreachable at the same time; We store edges
belonging to them in components. We remove all of those edges from memory, and
save them to database, If any of them were to be reachable again, we would
re-add them. This is useful in case there is a network split, to recover edges
if needed.</p>
<p>Each component is assigned a unique <code>nonce</code>, where first one is assigned nonce
0. Each new component, a get assigned a consecutive integer.</p>
<p>To store components, we have the following columns in the DB.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DBCol::LastComponentNonce</code> Stores <code>component_nonce: u64</code>, which is the last
used nonce.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes various development processes and best practices employed
at nearcore.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="code-style"><a class="header" href="#code-style">Code Style</a></h1>
<p>This document specifies the code style to use in the nearcore repository. The
primary goal here is to achieve consistency, maintain it over time, and cut down
on the mental overhead related to style choices.</p>
<p>Right now, <code>nearcore</code> codebase is not perfectly consistent, and the style
acknowledges this. It guides newly written code and serves as a tie breaker for
decisions. Rewriting existing code to conform 100% to the style is not a goal.
Local consistency is more important: if new code is added to a specific file,
it's more important to be consistent with the file rather than with this style
guide.</p>
<p>This is a live document, which intentionally starts in a minimal case. When
doing code-reviews, consider if some recurring advice you give could be moved
into this document.</p>
<h2 id="formatting"><a class="header" href="#formatting">Formatting</a></h2>
<p>Use <code>rustfmt</code> for minor code formatting decisions. This rule is enforced by CI</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <code>rustfmt</code> style is almost always good enough, even if not always
perfect. The amount of bikeshedding saved by <code>rustfmt</code> far outweighs any
imperfections.</p>
<h2 id="idiomatic-rust"><a class="header" href="#idiomatic-rust">Idiomatic Rust</a></h2>
<p>While the most important thing is to solve the problem at hand, we strive to
implement the solution in idiomatic Rust, if possible. To learn what is
considered idiomatic Rust, a good start are the Rust API guidelines (but keep in
mind that <code>nearcore</code> is not a library with public API, not all advice applies
literally):</p>
<p>https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html</p>
<p>When in doubt, ask question in the <a href="https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/300659-Rust-.F0.9F.A6.80">Rust
🦀</a> Zulip
stream or during code review.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Consistency, as there's usually only one idiomatic solution
amidst many non-idiomatic ones. Predictability, you can use the APIs without
consulting documentation. Performance, ergonomics and correctness: language
idioms usually reflect learned truths, which might not be immediately obvious.</p>
<h2 id="style"><a class="header" href="#style">Style</a></h2>
<p>This section documents all micro-rules which are not otherwise enforced by
<code>rustfmt</code>.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-asrefas_ref"><a class="header" href="#avoid-asrefas_ref">Avoid <code>AsRef::as_ref</code></a></h3>
<p>When you have some concrete type, prefer <code>.as_str</code>, <code>.as_bytes</code>, <code>.as_path</code> over
generic <code>.as_ref</code>. Only use <code>.as_ref</code> when the type in question is a generic
<code>T: AsRef&lt;U&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// GOOD
fn log_validator(account_id: AccountId) {
    metric_for(account_id.as_str())

    metric_for(account_id.as_ref())
       .increment()
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that <code>Option::as_ref</code>, <code>Result::as_ref</code> are great, use do use them!</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> readability and churn-resistance. There might be more than one
<code>AsRef&lt;U&gt;</code> implementation for a given type (with different <code>U</code>s). If a new
implementation is added, some of the <code>.as_ref()</code> calls might break. See also
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62586.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-references-to-copy-types"><a class="header" href="#avoid-references-to-copy-types">Avoid references to <code>Copy</code>-types</a></h3>
<p>Various generic APIs in Rust often return references to data (<code>&amp;T</code>). When <code>T</code> is
a small <code>Copy</code> type like <code>i32</code>, you end up with <code>&amp;i32</code> while many API expect
<code>i32</code>, so dereference has to happen <em>somewhere</em>. Prefer dereferencing as early
as possible, typically in a pattern:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// GOOD
fn compute(map: HashMap&lt;&amp;'str, i32&gt;) {
    if let Some(&amp;value) = map.get(&quot;key&quot;) {
        process(value)
    }
}
fn process(value: i32) { ... }

// BAD
fn compute(map: HashMap&lt;&amp;'str, i32&gt;) {
    if let Some(value) = map.get(&quot;key&quot;) {
        process(*value)
    }
}
fn process(value: i32) { ... }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> if the value is used multiple times, dereferencing in the pattern
saves keystrokes. If the value is used exactly once, we just want to be
consistent. Additional benefit of early deref is reduced scope of borrow.</p>
<p>Note that for some <em>big</em> <code>Copy</code> types, notably <code>CryptoHash</code>, we sometimes use
references for performance reasons. As a rule of thumb, <code>T</code> is considered <em>big</em> if
<code>size_of::&lt;T&gt;() &gt; 2 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="prefer-for-loops-over-for_each-and-try_for_each-methods"><a class="header" href="#prefer-for-loops-over-for_each-and-try_for_each-methods">Prefer for loops over <code>for_each</code> and <code>try_for_each</code> methods</a></h3>
<p>Iterators offer <code>for_each</code> and <code>try_for_each</code> methods which allow executing
a closure over all items of the iterator.  This is similar to using a for loop
but comes with various complications and may lead to less readable code.  Prefer
using a loop rather than those methods, for example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// GOOD
for outcome_with_id in result? {
    *total_gas_burnt =
        safe_add_gas(*total_gas_burnt, outcome_with_id.outcome.gas_burnt)?;
    outcomes.push(outcome_with_id);
}

// BAD
result?.into_iter().try_for_each(
    |outcome_with_id: ExecutionOutcomeWithId| -&gt; Result&lt;(), RuntimeError&gt; {
        *total_gas_burnt =
            safe_add_gas(*total_gas_burnt, outcome_with_id.outcome.gas_burnt)?;
        outcomes.push(outcome_with_id);
        Ok(())
    },
)?;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The <code>for_each</code> and <code>try_for_each</code> method don’t play nice with
<code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements nor do they mesh well with async IO (since
<code>.await</code> inside of the closure isn’t possible).  And while <code>try_for_each</code> allows
for the use of question mark operator, one may end up having to uses it twice:
once inside the closure and second time outside the call to <code>try_for_each</code>.
Furthermore, usage of the functions often introduce some minor syntax noise.</p>
<p>There are situations when those methods may lead to more readable code.  Common
example are long call chains.  Even then such code may evolve with the closure
growing and leading to less readable code.  If advantages of using the methods
aren’t clear cut, it’s usually better to err on side of more imperative style.</p>
<p>Lastly, anecdotally the methods (e.g. when used with <code>chain</code> or <code>flat_map</code>) may
lead to faster code.  This intuitively makes sense but it’s worth to keep in
mind that compilers are pretty good at optimising and in practice may generate
optimal code anyway.  Furthermore, optimising code for readability may be more
important (especially outside of hot path) than small performance gains.</p>
<h3 id="prefer-to_string-to-format"><a class="header" href="#prefer-to_string-to-format">Prefer <code>to_string</code> to <code>format!(&quot;{}&quot;)</code></a></h3>
<p>Prefer calling <code>to_string</code> method on an object rather than passing it through
<code>format!(&quot;{}&quot;)</code> if all you’re doing is converting it to a <code>String</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <code>to_string</code> is shorter to type and also faster.</p>
<h3 id="import-granularity"><a class="header" href="#import-granularity">Import Granularity</a></h3>
<p>Group import by module, but not deeper:</p>

<p>This corresponds to <code>&quot;rust-analyzer.assist.importGranularity&quot;: &quot;module&quot;</code> setting
in rust-analyzer
(<a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#rust-analyzer.assist.importGranularity">docs</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Consistency, matches existing practice.</p>
<h3 id="import-blocks"><a class="header" href="#import-blocks">Import Blocks</a></h3>
<p>Do not separate imports into groups with blank lines. Write a single block of
imports and rely on <code>rustfmt</code> to sort them.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Consistency, ease of automatic enforcement. Today stable rustfmt
can't split imports into groups automatically, and doing that manually
consistently is a chore.</p>
<h3 id="derives"><a class="header" href="#derives">Derives</a></h3>
<p>When deriving an implementation of a trait, specify a full path to the traits provided by the
external libraries:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// GOOD
#[derive(Copy, Clone, serde::Serialize, thiserror::Error, strum::Display)]

use serde::Serialize;
use thiserror::Error;
use strum::Display;

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Serialize, Error, Display)]
struct Banana;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>As an exception to this rule, it is okay to use either style when the derived trait already
includes the name of the library (as would be the case for <code>borsh::BorshSerialize</code>.)</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Specifying a full path to the externally provided derivations here makes it
straightforward to differentiate between the built-in derivations and those provided by the
external crates. The surprise factor for derivations sharing a name with the standard
library traits (<code>Display</code>) is reduced and it also acts as natural mechanism to tell apart names
prone to collision (<code>Serialize</code>), all without needing to look up the list of imports.</p>
<h2 id="standard-naming"><a class="header" href="#standard-naming">Standard Naming</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>-</code> rather than <code>_</code> in crate names and in corresponding folder names.</li>
<li>Avoid single-letter variable names especially in long functions.  Common <code>i</code>,
<code>j</code> etc. loop variables are somewhat of an exception but since Rust encourages
use of iterators those cases aren’t that common anyway.</li>
<li>Follow standard <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html">Rust naming patterns</a> such as:
<ul>
<li>Don’t use <code>get_</code> prefix for getter methods.  A getter method is one which
returns (reference to) a field of an object.</li>
<li>Use <code>set_</code> prefix for setter methods.  An exception are builder objects
which may use different naming style.</li>
<li>Use <code>into_</code> prefix for methods which consume <code>self</code> and <code>to_</code> prefix for
methods which don’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <code>get_block_header</code> rather than <code>get_header</code> for methods which return
a block header.</li>
<li>Don’t use <code>_by_hash</code> suffix for methods which lookup chain objects (blocks,
chunks, block headers etc.) by their hash (i.e. their primary identifier).</li>
<li>Use <code>_by_height</code> and similar suffixes for methods which lookup chain objects
(blocks, chunks, block headers etc.) by their height or other property which
is not their hash.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Consistency.</p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>When writing documentation in <code>.md</code> files, wrap lines at approximately 80
columns.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">&lt;!-- GOOD --&gt;
Manually reflowing paragraphs is tedious. Luckily, most editors have this
functionality built in or available via extensions. For example, in Emacs you
can use `fill-paragraph` (&lt;kbd&gt;M-q&lt;/kbd&gt;), (neo)vim allows rewrapping with `gq`,
and VS Code has `stkb.rewrap` extension.

&lt;!-- BAD --&gt;
One sentence per-line is also occasionally used for technical writing.
We avoid that format though.
While convenient for editing, it may be poorly legible in unrendered form

&lt;!-- BAD --&gt;
Definitely don't use soft-wrapping. While markdown mostly ignores source level line breaks, relying on soft wrap makes the source completely unreadable, especially on modern wide displays.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="tracing"><a class="header" href="#tracing"><a href="https://tracing.rs">Tracing</a></a></h2>
<p>When emitting events and spans with <code>tracing</code> prefer adding variable data via
<a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#recording-fields"><code>tracing</code>'s field mechanism</a>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// GOOD
debug!(
    target: &quot;client&quot;,
    validator_id = self.client.validator_signer.as_ref().map(|vs| {
        tracing::field::display(vs.validator_id())
    }),
    %hash,
    &quot;block.previous_hash&quot; = %block.header().prev_hash(),
    &quot;block.height&quot; = block.header().height(),
    %peer_id,
    was_requested
    &quot;Received block&quot;,
);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Most apparent violation of this rule will be when the event message utilizes any
form of formatting, as seen in the following example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// BAD
debug!(
    target: &quot;client&quot;,
    &quot;{:?} Received block {} &lt;- {} at {} from {}, requested: {}&quot;,
    self.client.validator_signer.as_ref().map(|vs| vs.validator_id()),
    hash,
    block.header().prev_hash(),
    block.header().height(),
    peer_id,
    was_requested
);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Always specify the <code>target</code> explicitly. A good default value to use is the crate
name, or the module path (e.g. <code>chain::client</code>) so that events and spans common
to a topic can be grouped together. This grouping can later be used for
customizing of which events to output.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This makes the events structured – one of the major value
propositions of the tracing ecosystem. Structured events allow for immediately
actionable data without additional post-processing, especially when using some
of the more advanced tracing subscribers. Of particular interest would be those
that output events as JSON, or those that publish data to distributed event
collection systems such as opentelemetry. Maintaining this rule will also
usually result in faster execution (when logs at the relevant level are enabled.)</p>
<h3 id="spans"><a class="header" href="#spans">Spans</a></h3>
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#spans">spans</a> to introduce context and grouping to and between events
instead of manually adding such information as part of the events themselves.
Most of the subscribers ingesting spans also provide a built-in timing facility,
so prefer using spans for measuring the amount of time a section of code needs
to execute.</p>
<p>Give spans simple names that make them both easy to trace back to code, and to
find a particular span in logs or other tools ingesting the span data. If a
span begins at the top of a function, prefer giving it a name of that function,
otherwise prefer a <code>snake_case</code> name.</p>
<p>Use the regular span API over convenience macros such as <code>#[instrument]</code>, as
this allows instrumenting portions of a function without affecting the code
structure:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn compile_and_serialize_wasmer(code: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;wasmer::Module&gt; {
    let _span = tracing::debug_span!(target: &quot;vm&quot;, &quot;compile_and_serialize_wasmer&quot;).entered();
    // ...
    // _span will be dropped when this scope ends, terminating the span created above.
    // You can also `drop` it manually, to end the span early with `drop(_span)`.
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Much as with events, this makes the information provided by spans
structured and contextual. This information can then be output to tooling in an
industry standard format, and can be interpreted by an extensive ecosystem of
<code>tracing</code> subscribers.</p>
<h3 id="event-and-span-levels"><a class="header" href="#event-and-span-levels">Event and span levels</a></h3>
<p>The <code>INFO</code> level is enabled by default, use it for information useful for node
operators. The <code>DEBUG</code> level is enabled on the canary nodes, use it for
information useful in debugging testnet failures. The <code>TRACE</code> level is not
generally enabled, use it for arbitrary debug output.</p>
<h2 id="metrics"><a class="header" href="#metrics">Metrics</a></h2>
<p>Consider adding metrics to new functionality. For example, how often each type
of error was triggered, how often each message type was processed.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Metrics are cheap to increment, and they often provide a significant
insight into operation of the code, almost as much as logging. But unlike logging
metrics don't incur a significant runtime cost.</p>
<h3 id="naming"><a class="header" href="#naming">Naming</a></h3>
<p>Prefix all <code>nearcore</code> metrics with <code>near_</code>.
Follow [https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/](Prometheus naming convention)
for new metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The <code>near_</code> prefix makes it trivial to separate metrics exported
by <code>nearcore</code> from other metrics, such as metrics about the state of the machine
that runs <code>neard</code>.</p>
<h3 id="performance"><a class="header" href="#performance">Performance</a></h3>
<p>In most cases incrementing a metric is cheap enough never to give it a second
thought. However accessing a metric with labels on a hot path needs to be done
carefully.</p>
<p>If a label is based on an integer, use a faster way of converting an integer
to the label, such as the <code>itoa</code> crate.</p>
<p>For hot code paths, re-use results of <code>with_label_values()</code> as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> We've encountered issues caused by the runtime costs of
incrementing metrics before. Avoid runtime costs of incrementing metrics too
often.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="protocol-upgrade"><a class="header" href="#protocol-upgrade">Protocol Upgrade</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the entire cycle of how a protocol upgrade is done, from
the initial PR to the final release. It is important for everyone who
contributes to the development of the protocol and its client(s) to understand
this process.</p>
<h3 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h3>
<p>At NEAR, we use protocol version to mean the version of the blockchain protocol
and is separate from the version of some specific client (such as nearcore),
since the protocol version defines the protocol rather than some specific
implementation of the protocol. More concretely, for each epoch, there is a
corresponding protocol version that is agreed upon by validators through <a href="https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/ChainSpec/Upgradability.md">a
voting
mechanism</a>.
Our upgrade scheme dictates that protocol version X is backward compatible with
protocol version X-1, so that nodes in the network can seamlessly upgrade into
the new protocol. However, there is <strong>no guarantee</strong> that protocol version X is
backward compatible with protocol version X-2.</p>
<p>Despite the upgrade mechanism, rolling out a protocol change can be scary,
especially if the change is invasive. For those changes, we may want to have
several months of testing before we are confident that the change itself works
and that it doesn't break other parts of the system.</p>
<h3 id="nightly-protocol-features"><a class="header" href="#nightly-protocol-features">Nightly Protocol features</a></h3>
<p>To make protocol upgrades more robust, we introduce the concept of nightly
protocol version together with the protocol feature flags to allow easy testing
of the cutting-edge protocol changes without jeopardizing the stability of the
codebase overall. In <code>Cargo.toml</code> file of the crates we have in nearcore, we
introduce rust compile-time features <code>nightly_protocol</code> and <code>nightly</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">nightly_protocol = []
nightly = [
    &quot;nightly_protocol&quot;,
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>nightly_protocol</code> is a marker feature that indicates that we are on
nightly protocol whereas <code>nightly</code> is a collection of new protocol features
which also implies <code>nightly_protocol</code>. For example, when we introduce EVM as a
new protocol change, suppose the current protocol version is 40, then we would
do the following change in Cargo.toml:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">nightly_protocol = []
nightly = [
    &quot;nightly_protocol&quot;,
    &quot;protocol_features_evm&quot;,
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>In <a href="practices/../core/primitives/src/version.rs">core/primitives/src/version.rs</a>, we would
change the protocol version by:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[cfg(feature = “nightly_protocol”)]
pub const PROTOCOL_VERSION: u32 = 100;
#[cfg(not(feature = “nightly_protocol”)]
pub const PROTOCOL_VERSION: u32 = 40;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This way the stable versions remain unaffected after the change. Note that
nightly protocol version intentionally starts at a much higher number to make
the distinction between stable protocol and nightly protocol more clear.</p>
<p>To determine whether a protocol feature is enabled, we do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We maintain a <code>ProtocolFeature</code> enum where each variant corresponds to some
protocol feature. For nightly protocol features, the variant is gated by the
corresponding rust compile-time feature.</li>
<li>We implement a function <code>protocol_version</code> to return, for each variant, the
corresponding protocol version in which the feature is enabled.</li>
<li>When we need to decide whether to use the new feature based on the protocol
version of the current network, we can simply compare it to the protocol
version of the feature. To make this simpler, we also introduced a macro
<code>checked_feature</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, please refer to
<a href="practices/../core/primitives/src/version.rs">core/primitives/src/version.rs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="feature-gating"><a class="header" href="#feature-gating">Feature Gating</a></h3>
<p>It is worth mentioning that there are two types of checks related to protocol features:</p>
<ul>
<li>For stable features, we check whether they should be enabled by checking the
protocol version of the current epoch. This does not involve any rust
compile-time features.</li>
<li>For nightly features, we have both the check of protocol version and the rust
compile-time feature gating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-1"><a class="header" href="#testing-1">Testing</a></h3>
<p>Nightly protocol features allow us to enable the most bleeding-edge code in some
testing environment. We can choose to enable all nightly protocol features by</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>cargo build -p neard --release --features nightly
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>or enable some specific protocol feature by</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>cargo build -p neard --release --features nightly_protocol,&lt;protocol_feature&gt;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In practice, we have all nightly protocol features enabled for Nayduck tests and
on betanet, which is updated daily.</p>
<h3 id="feature-stabilization"><a class="header" href="#feature-stabilization">Feature Stabilization</a></h3>
<p>New protocol features are introduced first as nightly features and when the
author of the feature thinks that the feature is ready to be stabilized, they
should submit a pull request to stabilize the feature using <a href="practices/../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/feature_stabilization.html">this
template</a>. In this
pull request, they should the feature gating, increase the <code>PROTOCOL_VERSION</code>
constant (if it hasn't been increased since the last release), and change the
<code>protocol_version</code> implementation to map the stabilized features to the new
protocol version.</p>
<p>A feature stabilization request must be approved by at least <strong>two</strong> <a href="https://github.com/orgs/near/teams/nearcore-codeowners">nearcore
code owners</a> Unless it
is a security related fix, a protocol feature cannot be included in any release
until at least <strong>one</strong> week after its stabilization. This is to ensure that
feature implementation and stabilization are not rushed.</p>

<p>This chapter holds various assorted bits of docs. If you want to document
something, but don't know where to put it, put it here!</p>
<h2 id="crate-versioning-and-publishing"><a class="header" href="#crate-versioning-and-publishing">Crate Versioning and Publishing</a></h2>
<p>While all the crates in the workspace are directly unversioned (<code>v0.0.0</code>), they
all share a unified variable version in the <a href="misc/Cargo.toml">workspace manifest</a>.
This keeps versions consistent across the workspace and informs their versions
at the moment of publishing.</p>
<p>We also have CI infrastructure set up to automate the publishing process to
crates.io.  So, on every merge to master, if there's a version change, it is
automatically applied to all the crates in the workspace and it attempts to
publish the new versions of all non-private crates.  All crates that should be
exempt from this process should be marked <code>private</code>.  That is, they should have
the <code>publish = false</code> specification in their package manifest.</p>
<p>This process is managed by
<a href="https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces">cargo-workspaces</a>, with a <a href="https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces/compare/master...miraclx:grouping-and-exclusion#files_bucket">bit
of
magic</a>
sprinkled on top.</p>
<h2 id="issue-labels"><a class="header" href="#issue-labels">Issue Labels</a></h2>
<p>Issue labels are of the following format <code>&lt;type&gt;-&lt;content&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> is a
capital letter indicating the type of the label and <code>&lt;content&gt;</code> is a hyphened
phrase indicating what is label is about.  For example, in the label <code>C-bug</code>,
<code>C</code> means category and <code>bug</code> means that the label is about bugs.  Common types
include <code>C</code>, which means category, <code>A</code>, which means area, <code>T</code>, which means team.</p>
<p>An issue can have multiple labels including which area it touches, which team
should be responsible for the issue, and so on.  Each issue should have at least
one label attached to it after it is triaged and the label could be a general
one, such as <code>C-enhancement</code> or <code>C-bug</code>.</p>
